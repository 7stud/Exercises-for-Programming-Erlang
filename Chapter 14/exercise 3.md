From what I've read, this exercise is too much of a security risk.  I would have to use port forwarding for port 22 from my router to my home computer.  Then go to the public library and use my laptop to try to connect to my router.  But I've read that once you do port forwarding for port 22, that port will receive a lot of attention from hackers.  Also, ISP's can change the ip address of your router, so I won't necessarily know which ip address to use for my remote node.
