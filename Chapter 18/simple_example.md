Joe Armstrong's **ezwebrame** code no longer works.  I asked for help on the erlang-questions forum with some of the errors I was getting, and Joe himself answered and essentially said, "It no longer works.  Tough luck."  Hmmm...I thought the whole point of posting the code on github was to keep it up to date.  Oh, well.

I decided to try and use [gun](https://github.com/ninenines/gun) for the http client, which has websocket support and is maintained by the same person who maintains cowboy, in order to interact with a cowboy server.
