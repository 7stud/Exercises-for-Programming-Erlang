# Solutions for the Exercises in Programming Erlang
Programming Erlang (2nd Ed.) Joe Armstrong

**Erlang 17.5**  (The book was written for that version, so that's the version I'm using.)

If you have a better or different answer click on Issues and post your answer.  Anyone looking for alternative answers should click on Issues under each chapter.  If you have a question about one of the solutions, post the question in an issue.  While I'm working on the book, I'll check back regularly.  After that, not so much.
