I got interested in the example on finding the synchronization header in an mp3 file.  There is a [treatise](http://mpgedit.org/mpgedit/mpeg_format/mpeghdr.htm) explaining the MPEG header format, as well as the formula for calculating the frame length.  With help from the [code sample](https://github.com/everpeace/programming-erlang-code/blob/master/code/mp3_sync.erl), I wrote my own function.
