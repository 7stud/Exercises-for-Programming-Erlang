The functions `maps:to_json(Map)`, etc. don't exist, so I installed `rebar3` and I created a project that specifies `jsx` as a dependency.  `jsx` is a third party json handling library for erlang.  To get setup with rebar3, see [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34278982/what-is-the-easiest-way-for-beginners-to-install-a-module).
